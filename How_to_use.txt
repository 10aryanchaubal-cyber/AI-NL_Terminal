3. KEY FEATURES EXPLAINED
---

(A) ROLLBACK & UNDO
    If you delete a file using NL-Terminal ("delete file..."), it is NOT lost forever.
    We create a temporary backup.
    
    > Command: "undo" or "rollback"
    > Action: Restores the last file you deleted.

(B) SAFETY SANDBOX
    - The terminal prevents you from accidentally deleting system files (like C:\Windows).
    - For dangerous actions, it asks: "Are you sure? [y/N]"

(C) MODES
    Switch modes by typing "mode <name>":
    
    - "mode beginner" : Helpful tips, previews commands before running.
    - "mode expert"   : Faster, fewer confirmations (commands run immediately if safe).
    - "mode safe"     : Paranoid mode. Asks confirmation for almost everything.

4. TROUBLESHOOTING
---
- If AI features aren't working:
  Make sure 'Ollama' is installed and running in the background.
  Run 'ollama run phi' in a separate terminal.

- If a command isn't understood:
  Try rephrasing it simply.
  Example: Instead of "trash this", say "delete file".

- To exit:
  Type "exit" or "quit".
